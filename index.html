        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This story moves through three Seattle places. As you scroll, the map
          will fly to each location and show a popup.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="downtown">
        <h2>Downtown / Pike Place</h2>
        <p>
          Downtown Seattle has long been a center of tourism and commerce, and the waterfront area
          continues to change with redevelopment and public projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="uw">
        <h2>University of Washington</h2>
        <p>
          The U-District reflects the impact of UW through high student housing demand, transit, and constant
          neighborhood development.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="rainier">
        <h2>Rainier Valley (Columbia City)</h2>
        <p>
          Rainier Valley is known for cultural diversity and neighborhood identity, while also
          experiencing growth and change along major transit developments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step end">
        <h2>Ending</h2>
        <p>
          These three places show how different parts of Seattle experience change in different ways which are
          through tourism, institutions, and community identity.
